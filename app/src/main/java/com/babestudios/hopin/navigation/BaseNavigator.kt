/**
 * [bind] currently needs to be called from both onCreate of the Activity and from the inject*Navigator() function.
 * This is because both the Dagger Component and the NavigationController needs to be initialized,
 * but the order of init is different in a normal case and when the Activity is recreated after a configuration change.
 * In the latter case the ViewModel is created and injected before onCreate() finishes.
 *
 * To avoid crashes use something like "::comp.isLazyInitialized" in OnCreate
 * and "::navController.isInitialized" in the provider.
 *
 * Also important is to save lateinit references to the [Navigator] and the [navController],
 * so these are not null in the ViewModel.
